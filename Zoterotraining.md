## 1 Overview
### 1.1 What is Zotero?

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a project of the Corporation for Digital Scholarship, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the development of software and services for researchers and cultural heritage institutions. It is a free, open-source reference management software to manage bibliographic data and related research materials (such as, for example, PDF files). Notable features include web browser integration, online syncing, generation of in-text citations, footnotes, and bibliographies, as well as integration with the word processors Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer, and Google Docs.

In Zotero, users can generate citations and bibliographies through word processor plugins (or directly in Zotero) using Citation Style Language styles. The house styles of most academic journals are available in Zotero, and the bibliography can be reformatted with a few clicks. Zotero also allows users to create their own customized citation styles.

Zotero can import and export citations from or to many formats, including Wikipedia Citation Templates,[7] BibTeX, BibLateX, RefWorks, MODS, COinS, Citation Style Language/JSON, refer/BibIX, RIS, TEI, several flavours of RDF, Evernote, and EndNote.

## 3 Using Zotero for the IsisCB

The collection process is divided into two general steps:

- Collecting citations
- Tagging and classifying citations

[^ Up to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### 3.1 Collecting citations with Zotero

[^ Up to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### 3.1.1 Journal Articles

1. Check the [JournalsRank1and2.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v04WA7uml6JRtTCLOdDu0C55JaBJ5modPxqYRK2JM3M/edit#gid=881820069) spreadsheet to ensure that issue has not already been claimed by another assistant. 
2. If the issue has not yet been collected, claim the issue on the [JournalsRank1and2.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v04WA7uml6JRtTCLOdDu0C55JaBJ5modPxqYRK2JM3M/edit#gid=881820069) spreadsheet and either use the Zotero button to automatically harvest article data for an entire issue from websites/hard copies or manually input the information for all articles in an issue in the appropriate fields for each article in individual and separate Zotero records. 
 - _If the journal article is a book review_, check Zotero and IsisCB Explore to see if the book is already included in the database. _Note: when searching for books on the non-public face of the IsisCB, at the time of this writing, one cannot include punctuation marks in the search fields, else the search does not display results correctly (i.e., no results will display)._
   - _If no record is found_, then harvest the book information into a properly formatted folder (for more information, see [Zotero File Structure](http://wiki.isiscb.org/Zotero_file_structure)) in the current “IsisCB” Library and import said book record before ingesting the journal article book review. For more information, consult the section on this Wiki page concerning Books.
   - _If a record is found in Zotero or IsisCB Explore_, create a second author field in the record in Zotero and indicate this field as a “Reviewed Author” field. Next, enter the ISBN or CBB number from IsisCB into this field the Zotero record before ingesting it.
 - _If the journal article is not a book review_, simply ingest the citation into Zotero. No further action is needed until the tagging and classifying step as described below.
3. Things to consider:
 - Relate the first article in the series or the introductory article or dossier to all of the following article in the series or special issue that correspond with the subject.
 - If the journals are in a series or a focus section, make sure that the introductory or lead article is “related” (Zotero’s term for connecting items) to it. Alternatively, these relationships can be created after the ingestion process in the IsisCB directly.
 - If an article is a review of thesis, format the Reviewed Author as “review of thesis: title of thesis” (Since there is no ISBN)
 - Generally, the required fields for journals are: Item type, Title, Author(s), Abstract, Publication, Volume Issue, Pages or Word Count, Date, Journal Abbreviation, Language, DOI, ISSN. If you have questions about specific fields for specific items, discuss the items with the bibliographer.
 - If there are no page numbers for articles or reviews, put {Approx ### words}.

#### 3.1.2 Books (Single and Chapter)

1. Check Zotero and IsisCB Explore to see if the book is already included in the database. If no record is found, then harvest the book information from WorldCat or other sources using the Zotero Button or manually entering the information into a properly formatted folder (for more information, see [Zotero File Structure](http://wiki.isiscb.org/Zotero_file_structure)) in the current “IsisCB” Library. _Note: when searching for books on the non-public face of the IsisCB, at the time of this writing, one cannot include punctuation marks in the search fields, else the search does not display results correctly (i.e., no results will display)._
    1. _If the book is a Chapter Book, _defined as book which includes chapters which are authored by multiple individuals, then:
        1. Consider the relevance of the book.
        2. _If the book is suitably relevant to the scope of the IsisCB (consult the bibliographer if unsure)_, harvest the book information from WorldCat or other sources using the Zotero Button or manually entering the information into a properly formatted folder (for more information, see [Zotero File Structure](http://wiki.isiscb.org/Zotero_file_structure)) in the current “IsisCB” Library, which in this case, would adhere to the guidelines for Chapter Books. Further, add records for the chapters of the book in the following manner:
            1. Duplicate the book record in Zotero, alter the “Item Type” of this duplicated section from “Book” to “Book Section,” and clear the 
            2. Delete editor(s)’ name(s) from the chapters and only keep the author(s) for each chapter.
        3. _If the book is less relevant to the scope of the IsisCB, but a few chapters in the book are relevant (consult the bibliographer if unsure)_, harvest the book information as noted above, but only create files for the relevant chapters (i.e., do not create Zotero records for _all_ chapters as noted above, only relevant chapters). Further, if the topics covered in these chapters is suitably distinct from the general subject of the book, classify and subject tag each chapter individually and separately.
        4. _If the book is less relevant to the scope of the IsisCB (consult the bibliographer if unsure)_, harvest the book information as noted above, but do not add records for the chapters of the book. Instead, copy or manually enter the table of contents of said book into the abstract field of the book’s Zotero record. 
    2. _If the book is a Single Book, _so considered as any book which is not a chapter book as defined, simply ingest the citation into Zotero. No further action is needed until the tagging and classifying step as described below.
2. Things to consider:
    3. Generally, the required fields for books are: Item Type, Title, Author/Editor, Abstract, Series, Place, Publisher, Date Pages, Language, ISBN, Short Title. If you have questions about specific fields for specific items, discuss the items with the bibliographer.

#### 3.1.4 Guidelines for collecting non-English citations

1. TITLES:
  - Keep the title in the original language (this includes languages with symbols because we are now using Unicode). Put the translation in {alt. Title: ...} in the extra field.
  - If the publication provides an English translation of the title, you may add the translated title as {atl. title: Translated Title} in the “Extras Field”
  - DO NOT use Google Translate for the entered title. You may use it in notes for yourself but not in any space that will be published. There is one exception, if the entered title is in a language using non-Latin script and outside of the European language set, then provide the Google translated title in {alt. title: Translated Title}
2. ABSTRACTS:
  - If the article provides a translated abstract, you may put the English translation in the “abstract” field (if it is provided by the source). If not, keep the abstract in the original language.
  - DO NOT use Google Translate for the abstract. You may use it in notes for yourself but not in any space that will be published. There is one exception, if the entered title is in a language using non-Latin script and outside of the European language set, then provide the Google translated title in {alt. title: Translated Title}
  - Enter the Google translated abstract in the extra field using the same rules that apply to translated titles, as noted above.
3. OTHER FIELDS:
  - As for other fields, like author, publisher, place the field need to be transliterated into latin text so that it can be searched and used in Explore. (VIAF and ORCID will provide the proper transliterated author name.)
 - Authorities should be transliterated into Latin so that they are searchable.

### 3.2 Tagging: the IsisCB Classification Scheme

[^ Up to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### 3.3 Keeping folders (well) organized

[^ Up to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### 3.3.1 File Structure
A new IsisCB library shall be created each calendar year in the following format, with the following year updated every calendar year: IsisCB 2017. Further, the library shall include (1) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">working folders for each individual contributing towards the yearly bibliography</span> and (2) an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ingested folder</span>, a folder included to denote work that has already been completed each year.

[^ Up to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### 3.3.2 Working Folders
The bibliographer and the and bibliographer’s assistants shall have designated folders to organize work in progress. These folders shall be named in the following format: 000-Weldon Working (i.e., three zeros, a dash, the individual’s last name, followed by a space and ‘Working’). The contents and organization structure of these folders are left to each individual’s preferences. However, general rules and suggestions apply:

1. The IsisCB staff has found that for their purposes, a system that has a folder for books and separate folders for journals/issues works very well. It might also prove helpful to include a folder for works that are under consideration for inclusion.
2. When collecting journal issues/articles, create a folder for each journal, within which include subfolders for each issue of each volume. Further, ensure that the items are added only to the issue subfolder, not to the main journal folder -- please eliminate all duplicate entries if you find them residing in the main journal folder.
3. Books are to be added within dated, named folders (named for the assistant compiling the books within the folder) denoting that all titles within the folder are Single Books. The naming convention of these folders is not absolute, but they should convey the compiler of the folder, the status of the books as Single Books, and a date. For example, “Weldon Single Books 2016.05.23”. 
4. If a books contains chapters (i.e., the book includes chapter which are authored by multiple individuals) create a separate folder for that book. The name of the folder should be editor surname and publication date (i.e., Smith 2014).

[^ Up to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### 3.3.3 Ingested Folders

The ingested folder will include three folders: CHAPTER BOOKS, SINGLE BOOKS, and JOURNAL ISSUES. After exporting items from Zotero and importing them into the IsisCB, move the folder(s) from the appropriate Working Folder into the appropriate folder within the Ingested folder (i.e., CHAPTER BOOKS, SINGLE BOOKS, or JOURNAL ISSUES). 

1. CHAPTER BOOKS: This folder will contain the named and dated folders for Chapter Books, thus defined as book which include chapters which are authored by multiple individuals. 
2. SINGLE BOOKS: This folder will contain named and dated folders for Single Books, thus defined as _all remainder books_ which are not Chapter Books.
3. JOURNAL ISSUES: This folder will contain the ingested folder(s), one for each journal, within which include subfolders for each issue of each volume. Note: _Do only include one journal folder for each journal title in this folder. If you ingest additional issues for a journal title, only move the issue subfolder into the Ingested Folder.
