See [Zotero file structure](http://wiki.isiscb.org/Zotero_file_structure) for information about how to organize the harvested citations.*

# Collecting Citations

## Before We Begin

The Isis Current Bibliography is a research tool for those interested in the history of science, technology and medicine as well as related fields. The Isis CB has two current formats: It is published annually in a physical copy and also available online at [Isis CB online](https://data.isiscb.org/).

### The online dataset is composed of three main types of records

1. Citations, bibliographic entries that have been classified and indexed. These include but are not limited to:
    1. Books and chapters
    2. Articles, essay reviews, and book reviews
    3. Theses (Dissertations)
    4. Web objects (websites, online exhibitions, et al)
    5. Multimedia objects (Podcasts, documentaries et al)
3. Authorities, identity records for the subject and category tags as well as all authors and contributors, publishers, journals, and thesis granting institutions
4. Relationships, records that link citations and authorities to each other creating a semantic web that powers the search and facet features

*See (Isis CB About page)[https://data.isiscb.org/isis/about] for more information on the online platform.

If you go to the online bibliography and do a quick search, you will find that the bibliographic breadth of the Isis CB is quite liberal in its interpretation of what constitutes history of science, technology and medicine. This is by design, the Bibliography is an inclusive bibliography and as such does not discriminate based on publisher, journal or author. If it can be interpreted as history of science, technology or medicine, it is a relevant candidate for entry into the bibliography.

### Tools You Will Need:

1. Open Zotero on your computer.
2. Create and correctly label a folder for collecting citations.
3. The Zotero web extension installed and active on your internet browser. 

*For more information on Zotero and the Zotero web extension see [Zotero Training](https://github.com/IsisCB/IsisCB-Carpentry/blob/main/Zoterotraining.md)*

### Where to Find Citations

1. Focus on what you know. This is the best place to start because it allows you to familiarize yourself with the bibliography and discover what you can contribute uniquely. Check your bookshelf, course syllabi, bibliographies, favorite journals, authors, blogs, and podcasts. Search the online bibliography to discover what is already included and what may be missing. If there are gaps, this is a great place to start making your contributions.
2. A standard resource for contributors is the Isis CB journal list which provides a list of known journals that deal with the history of science, technology and medicine. (Scan list journals)[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v04WA7uml6JRtTCLOdDu0C55JaBJ5modPxqYRK2JM3M/edit] The listed journals on the list are ranked into three categories:
    1. Rank 1. Enter all.
    2. Rank 2. Many of the articles and reviews may be relevant.
    3. Rank 3. Some of the articles and reviews may be relevant.
3. List of recieved books from Isis and other major journals
4. Publishers' recent publications lists related to the history of science, technology and medicine and distributors's websites (amazon et al)
5. Dissertation abstracts
6. Libguides related to the history of science, technology and medicine
7. Newsletters
8. Listservs
9. Social media resources (Academia.edu, Researchgate, (Humanities Commons)[https://hcommons.org/], twitter et al)
10. Museum exhibition and catalogues
11. Volunteer contributor's list (Isis CB Gmail)


## General Tips, Rules and Guidelines for Collecting Citations

1. The best place to get citations and abstracts are from the publisher. Google books, and Amazon are also good places to get good citations and abstracts.
2. Don’t ever trust the information in WorldCat; always verify with a second source if possible; beware, especially, of the title and authors.
3. Don’t try to pull too many things (as a general rule try to limit the number of items to 20 or less) from a website at once or else the publisher may lock you out for a time. If this happens, you can attempt to access the website after a short interlude.


## Thing to Remember When Collecting Records into Zotero

1. Make sure the target folder is selected or open in Zotero before hitting the Zotero button, otherwise the information will go to the general directory or an incorrect folder.
2. Check title: for capitalization errors, random information harvested by Zotero, proper italics (italics are marked in Zotero by &lt; i > xxx &lt; / i > or &lt;em> xxx &lt;/em> ), check accent marks, check title for author misplacement
3. Check author name order, capitalization.
4. Make sure that editors or other contributors are not marked as authors.
5. If possible, make sure to collect a [DOI](http://wiki.isiscb.org/index.php?title=DOI&action=edit&redlink=1), publisher’s URL, [ISBN](http://wiki.isiscb.org/index.php?title=ISBN&action=edit&redlink=1), [ISSN](http://wiki.isiscb.org/index.php?title=ISSN&action=edit&redlink=1) for the object.
    1. DOI: [https://www.doi.org/](https://www.doi.org/)
    2. URL: Sometimes we put URL when there is DOI, because some publishers do not have them published. Check to make sure the URL is not specific to your library, so that user without access can find the correct URL.
    3. ISBN: These are not always provided by WorldCat, sometimes you will need to go look at Amazon, AbeBooks, or the publisher’s website.
    4. ISSN: This is the journal’s identification number. This is almost always found on the journal’s publisher site (i.e. Brill, SagePub, Wiley, Cambridge, Oxford, etc.)
6. Check to ensure a language is entered in the language field. Frequently the language field is not harvested.


## Guidelines for Collecting Citations

### Books and Chapters

1. Once you have found a book or group of book chapters, check Zotero and IsisCB Explore to see if the book or chapters are already included in the database. If no record is found, then harvest the book information from WorldCat or other sources using the Zotero Button or manually entering the information into a properly formatted folder (for more information, see [Zotero File Structure](http://wiki.isiscb.org/Zotero_file_structure)) in the current “IsisCB” Library. 
*Note: when searching for books on the non-public face of the IsisCB, at the time of this writing, one cannot include punctuation marks in the search fields, else the search does not display results correctly (i.e., no results will display)._

    1. If the book is a Chapter Book, defined as book which includes chapters which are authored by multiple individuals, then:
        1. Consider the relevance of the book.
        2. If the book is suitably relevant to the scope of the IsisCB (consult the bibliographer if unsure), harvest the book information from WorldCat or other sources using the Zotero Button or manually entering the information into a properly formatted folder (for more information, see [Zotero File Structure](http://wiki.isiscb.org/Zotero_file_structure)) in the current “IsisCB” Library, which in this case, would adhere to the guidelines for Chapter Books. Further, add records for the chapters of the book in the following manner:
            1. Duplicate the book record in Zotero, alter the “Item Type” of this duplicated section from “Book” to “Book Section,” and clear the 
            2. Delete editor(s)’ name(s) from the chapters and only keep the author(s) for each chapter.
        3. If the book is less relevant to the scope of the IsisCB, but a few chapters in the book are relevant (consult the bibliographer if unsure), harvest the book information as noted above, but only create files for the relevant chapters (i.e., do not create Zotero records for all chapters as noted above, only relevant chapters). Further, if the topics covered in these chapters is suitably distinct from the general subject of the book, classify and subject tag each chapter individually and separately.
        4. If the book is less relevant to the scope of the IsisCB (consult the bibliographer if unsure), harvest the book information as noted above, but do not add records for the chapters of the book. Instead, copy or manually enter the table of contents of said book into the abstract field of the book’s Zotero record. 
    2. If the book is a Single Book, so considered as any book which is not a chapter book as defined, simply ingest the citation into Zotero. No further action is needed until the tagging and classifying step as described below.

2. Things to consider:
    1. Generally, the required fields for books are: Item Type, Title, Author/Editor, Abstract, Series, Place, Publisher, Date Pages, Language, ISBN, Short Title. If you have questions about specific fields for specific items, discuss the items with the bibliographer.


### Journal Articles, Essay Reviews and Book Reviews

1. Check the [JournalsRank1and2.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v04WA7uml6JRtTCLOdDu0C55JaBJ5modPxqYRK2JM3M/edit#gid=881820069) spreadsheet to ensure that issue has not already been claimed by another assistant. 
2. If the issue has not yet been collected, claim the issue on the [JournalsRank1and2.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v04WA7uml6JRtTCLOdDu0C55JaBJ5modPxqYRK2JM3M/edit#gid=881820069) spreadsheet and either use the Zotero button to automatically harvest article data for an entire issue from websites/hard copies or manually input the information for all articles in an issue in the appropriate fields for each article in individual and separate Zotero records. 
    1. _If the journal article is a book review_, check Zotero and IsisCB Explore to see if the book is already included in the database. _Note: when searching for books on the non-public face of the IsisCB, at the time of this writing, one cannot include punctuation marks in the search fields, else the search does not display results correctly (i.e., no results will display)._
        1. _If no record is found_, then harvest the book information into a properly formatted folder (for more information, see [Zotero File Structure](http://wiki.isiscb.org/Zotero_file_structure)) in the current “IsisCB” Library and import said book record before ingesting the journal article book review. For more information, consult the section on this Wiki page concerning Books.
        2. _If a record is found in Zotero or IsisCB Explore_, create a second author field in the record in Zotero and indicate this field as a “Reviewed Author” field. Next, enter the ISBN or CBB number from IsisCB into this field the Zotero record before ingesting it.
    2. _If the journal article is not a book review_, simply ingest the citation into Zotero. No further action is needed until the tagging and classifying step as described below.
3. Things to consider:
    3. Relate the first article in the series or the introductory article or dossier to all of the following article in the series or special issue that correspond with the subject.
    4. If the journals are in a series or a focus section, make sure that the introductory or lead article is “related” (Zotero’s term for connecting items) to it. Alternatively, these relationships can be created after the ingestion process in the IsisCB directly.
    5. If an article is a review of thesis, format the Reviewed Author as “review of thesis: title of thesis” (Since there is no ISBN)
    6. Generally, the required fields for journals are: Item type, Title, Author(s), Abstract, Publication, Volume Issue, Pages or Word Count, Date, Journal Abbreviation, Language, DOI, ISSN. If you have questions about specific fields for specific items, discuss the items with the bibliographer.
    7. If there are no page numbers for articles or reviews, put {Approx ### words}.


### Dissertations & Thesis

1. In addition to the author of the text, change the advisers to “contributors” in the author field.
2. Put the University where it was published
3. In the extra field put the description of what each actually did.


### Web Objects (websites, online exhibitions, et al)


### Multimedia objects (Podcasts, documentaries et al)


### Guidelines for collecting non-English citations

1. Titles:
    1. Keep the title in the original language (this includes languages with symbols because we are now using Unicode). Put the translation in {alt. Title: ...} in the extra field.
    2. If the publication provides an English translation of the title, you may add the translated title as {atl. title: Translated Title} in the “Extras Field”
    3. DO NOT use Google Translate for the entered title. You may use it in notes for yourself but not in any space that will be published. There is one exception, if the entered title is in a language using non-Latin script and outside of the European language set, then provide the Google translated title in {alt. title: Translated Title}
2. Abstracts:
    4. If the article provides a translated abstract, you may put the English translation in the “abstract” field (if it is provided by the source). If not, keep the abstract in the original language.
    5. DO NOT use Google Translate for the abstract. You may use it in notes for yourself but not in any space that will be published. There is one exception, if the entered title is in a language using non-Latin script and outside of the European language set, then provide the Google translated title in {alt. title: Translated Title}
    6. Enter the Google translated abstract in the extra field using the same rules that apply to translated titles, as noted above.
3. Other fields:
    7. As for other fields, like author, publisher, place the field need to be transliterated into latin text so that it can be searched and used in Explore. (VIAF and ORCID will provide the proper transliterated author name.)
    8. Authorities should be transliterated into Latin so that they searchable.


## Instructions for SHOT editors ## (SPW decide where to put it)

We are going to have you enter new subject tags as you like from GND. If you do so, please provide the name and add the permalink URI for the authority in the GND database in curly brackets, as follows: Zeitdilatation {URI: [http://d-nb.info/gnd/4348523-6}](http://d-nb.info/gnd/4348523-6%7D) Once you add that one time, it should appear as a suggestion in your Zotero database every time you enter it after that.

If you do that, then we will add that as a new subject authority in our database, gradually accumulating GND approved authorities. If you are entering a new name, I would prefer that you use VIAF if at all possible. Enter those in the same way but add birth/death dates in parentheses before the URI in the following form if possible: (xxxx-) (xxxx-xxxx) (-xxxx). If it is more complicated than that, with approximate dates or dates BC, etc. then just put them in as they are and we will figure it out. So here's an example: Humboldt, Alexander von (1769-1859) {URI: [http://viaf.org/viaf/95193235}](http://viaf.org/viaf/95193235%7D) If there is no VIAF ID, then use the GND URI.

Finally, let me encourage you to use the English terms for at least the most important terms so that people searching will be able to find the works more easily. Eventually, we will create a set of SKOS relationships that will facilitate the interlinking of terms.
