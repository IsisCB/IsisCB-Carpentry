## Import from Zotero Procedures

Make sure folder is ready for export

1. Keep import sets relatively small (no more than about 30 is probably a good rule of thumb).
2. Import books first. They are needed for book reviews.
3. Import books and associated chapters together in the same import.
    1. If you have a book with a lot of chapters, it is best to import those in a single isolated import.
    2. Otherwise, you can import a few books and associated chapters at the same time.
4. Import journal articles after the books because they will frequently contain what Zotero considers to be “articles” that are, in fact, book reviews linked to books that you should already have added to Explore.
5. We also don’t have a view for websites or other digital media but there may be some reviews of these as well.

Move Zotero directory to Exported Directory

Move Zotero directory to the appropriate folder as described by the [Zotero file structure](http://wiki.isiscb.org/Zotero_file_structure).

Proofread citations in Zotero

Before exporting a folder, go over all records and try to ensure that everything is in order for each record in that folder, both in the Info tab and in the Tags tab. This will minimize changes we have to make in Explore.

Pay particular attention to the following common issues:

*   Format of names.
*   Make sure the language is set.

For complete list of expected format see [collecting using Zotero](http://wiki.isiscb.org/Collecting_citations_using_Zotero).

Export from Zotero

While in Zotero, export the file to RDF.

1. Make sure the folder you want to export, and only this folder, is selected.
2. Go to File -> Export Library...
3. From the dialog box slect "Zotero RDF" as Format. Uncheck Export Notes and Export Files.
4. Save the file naming it with the folder name and today's date. eg. "Books A-2016.11.28.rdf" (note the folder into which you are saving the file. Best practice is to have a dedicated folder on your computer to save the Zotero RDF export files.)

Back up to IsisCB Google Drive backup folder

After successfully ingesting the citation, backup the Zotero RDF folder to the IsisCB Google Drive backup folder.

Import to Explore

Go to the [Zotero Accession page](https://data.isiscb.org/zotero/accession/) in the curatorial interface of Explore (you must be logged in with curatorial privileges to access this page.)

Use the **+Upload RDF** button to create a new accession. See [IsisCB Curation Zotero Accession](http://wiki.isiscb.org/IsisCB_Curation_Zotero_Accession#Upload_RDF) page for detailed instructions.

Curate, Resolve, then Ingest

Curate and Resolve the records:

1. Resolve (i.e., match) the authorities of each citation that was not automatically resolved during the import process by clicking on the check mark of the record which matches the unresolved term.
2. If no record matches the unresolved term, create the new term by clicking the create button.
    1. If created new term is a name, log it in the [New Authorities from Zotero Ingest](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rBYnxisv8E12y17KMKaYwieXzFrgJF_sPHhOkumPmnQ/edit?ts=58b84963#gid=1367483399) spreadsheet.
3. After all unresolved terms are resolved, click the Ingest button at the top of the page.
4. View records individually to verify that they ingested properly and the records are sound.

Bibliographer approval

Next the bibliographer will review the records. Once they are satisfied, the bibliographer will publish the records on Explore.
